# replit-database-api
A drop-in replacement for Replit's built-in database API using Node and Express.js

See the top of the code for instructions. If you're migrating a replit repository to another server but don't want to rewrite database code, and you're already using node, it should be plug-and-play for both JS and curl.

That said, it's messy. Use with caution.
